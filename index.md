#Alyssa Smith

I'm an MIT sophomore studying comparative media studies (CMS) and computer science.  Some of my interests include learning about people through the data they generate and using code to make the world a kinder and more equitable place. 
    
## Completed Projects
[apocalypse moon](http://alyssa-smith.github.io/moon-orbits-earth): a simulation of the moon in an elliptical orbit that brings it much closer to Earth

[markov-generated rush lyrics](http://alyssa-smith.github.io/markov-rush): markov chain modeling of Rush lyrics. hilarity ensues. actually some of this is pretty deep.
    

##In progress
[fanfiction analysis](http://alyssa-smith.github.io/fanfiction): in my spare time i've been writing a web scraper that grabs works from archiveofourown.org. i plan to analyze the text of works to see what patterns exist in the readers' choices, the authors' word choice, and therefore understand how and why people read and write fanfiction.
